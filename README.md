# Unity Scene Conflict Resolver
---
This project aims to resolve merge conflicts in Unity scene files visually within the Unity Editor. Unity scene files use a custom YAML format, making conflict resolution in a text editor impossible for a game-designer or developer that has no experience about UnityYAML structure. 

**Tool features** : 
* Detect changes between two distinct scene files
* Visualize differences inside UnityEditor
* Let user select the preferred variants
* Apply the changes on editor level.

**Package Location** :  _Packages/com.blockville.sceneconflictresolver_

This project has been paused and is not planned to continue for now.
